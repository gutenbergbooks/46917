<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="center font09 pmb2">"An air is more lasting than the voice of the birds,<br />
A word is more lasting than the riches of the world."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The truth of this Irish proverb strikes us forcibly as we
glance through any such collection of Gaelic poetry as this,
and consider how these lays, the dates of whose composition
extend from the eighth to the present century, have
been preserved to us.</p>

<p>On the border of some grave manuscript, such as a Latin
copy of St. Paul's Epistles or a transcript of Priscian, a stray
quatrain may be found jotted down by the tired scribe,
recording in impromptu verse his delight at the note of a
blackbird whose song has penetrated his cell, his amusement
at the gambols of his cat watching a mouse, or his
reflections on a piece of news brought to him by some
wandering monk, about the terror of the viking raids, or a
change of dynasty "at home in Ireland."</p>

<p>Several of our Ossianic poems are taken from a manuscript
of lays collected in 1626-27 in and about the Glens
of Antrim, and sent out to while away the tedium of
camp life to an Irish officer serving in the Low Countries,
who wearied for the poems and stories of his youth. The
religious hymns of Murdoch O'Daly (Muredach Albanach),
called "the Scot" on account of his affection for
his adopted country, though he was born in Connaught,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
are preserved in a collection of poems gathered in the
Western Highlands, many Irish poems, even from so
great a distance as Munster, being found in it.</p>

<p>The Saltair na Rann or "Psalter of the Verses," the
most important religious poem of ancient Ireland, is
preserved in one copy only. It seems as though a
miracle had sometimes intervened to guard for later
generations some single version of a valuable tract at
home or abroad; but it is a miracle which we could
have wished to have taken place more often, when we
reflect upon the large number of manuscripts forever lost
to us.</p>

<p>Many of the most beautiful of the ancient poems, as
well as of the popular songs, are anonymous; they are
frequently found mixed up with material of the most
arid description, genealogies, annals, or miscellaneous
matter. It is easier to guess from the tone of the poems
under what mood of mind they were composed than to
tell exactly who wrote them. Even when they come
down to us adorned with the name of some well-known
saint or poet, we have an uncertain feeling about the
accuracy of the ascription, when we find a poem whose
language cannot be earlier than the tenth or eleventh
century confidently connected with a writer who lived
two or three centuries earlier. In some cases, no doubt,
the versions we possess, though modernised in language
and rhythm, are in reality old; in others the ascription
probably bears witness to the desire of the author or his
public to win esteem for his work by adorning it with
some famous name. Some of these poems, of which only
one copy has come down to us, were, however, well
known in an earlier day, and are quoted in old tracts on
Irish metric as examples of the metres used in the bardic
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
schools. It is evident that though standards of taste
may change, the recognition of what is really beautiful
in poetry remains as a settled instinct in man's nature.
Many of those poems which now appeal most strongly
to ourselves took rank as verses of acknowledged merit
nearer to the time of their composition. This we can
deduce from their use as examples worthy of imitation
in these medi&#230;val Irish text-books, where the names of
songs we still admire are quoted as specimens of good
poetry.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that a very large proportion of fine
poetry comes to us from the period of the Norse invasions,
a time which we are accustomed to think of as one continuous
series of wars, raids, and burnings; but which,
if we may judge by what has come down to us of its verse,
shows us that the Irish gentleman of that day had ideas
of refinement that raise him far above the mere fighting
clansman; his critical view of literature was a severe one.
The fine freedom shown in many of these poems is surprising,
both as regards the sentiments and the metres.
They possess a mastery of form that argues a high cultivation,
not only of the special art of poetry, but of the
whole intellectual faculties of the writers.</p>

<p>Some of these poems are strangely modern, even <i>fin
de si&egrave;cle</i> in their tone. The poem of the "Old Woman
of Beare" has often been compared to Villon's "Regrets
de la Belle Heaulmi&egrave;re ja parvenue &agrave; viellesse," or to
B&eacute;ranger's "Grand'm&egrave;re." But the Irish poem is far
more artistically wrought than either of these comparatively
modern poems. For in the ancient verses, the old
woman is set, a lonely and forsaken figure, against the
background of the ebbing tide, and the slow throbs of
her heart, worn with age and sin, beat in unison with the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
retreating motion of the wave. There is also a further
significance in the poem which we must not miss. It is
the earliest of the long series of allegorical songs in which
Ireland is depicted under the form of a woman; though,
unlike her successors of a later day, she is here represented,
not as a fair maiden, a Grainne Mhaol, or Kathleen ni
Houlahan, or Little Mary Cuillenan, but as an aged joyless
hag, forlorn and censorious, bemoaning the loss of
bygone pleasures, and the gravity of her nun's veil. The
"Cailleach Bheara," the "Hag" or "Nun of Beare" is
known in many place-names in Ireland. It is on Slieve
na Callighe, or the "Hill of the Hag" or "Nun," in
Co. Meath that the great cairns and tumuli of Lough
Crew are found; it was evidently, like the neighbourhood
of the Boyne, a place of pagan sanctity; and such
names as Tober na Callighe Bheara, the "Well of the Hag
of Beare," are found in different parts of the country.
The "Hag of Beare" seems to be symbolic of pagan
Ireland, regretting the stricter regime of Christianity,
and the changes that time had brought about. The
curious legend which prefaces the poem suggests the
same idea. She is said to have seen seven periods of
youth, and to have outlived tribes and races descended
from her. For a hundred years of old age she wore the
veil of a nun. "Thereupon old age and infirmity came
upon her." We catch the same note of regret for the
days of paganism through many legends and poems. It
is mystical and veiled in such stories as that of "King
Murtough and the Witch-woman"; it is fierce, but also
often touched by the grotesque, in the innumerable
colloquies between Patrick and Ois&iacute;n (Ossian), the last
of the ancient pagan heroes. But in all this there is a
note of apology. It is not so outspoken in its revolt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
against the new system of life and thought as are the
Norse chronicles and the Icelandic Sagas. After all,
Christianity was an accomplished thing; quietly but
persistently it took its place, sweeping into its fold chiefs
and common folk alike. No resistance could stop this
universal progress. And the literary man or the peasant,
dwelling on his early legends, the outcome of a state of
thought passed or passing away, dared only half-heartedly
bemoan the former days, when wars and raids, the
"Creach" and the "T&aacute;in" were the highest way of
life for a brave man, and no Christian doctrine of forgiveness
of enemies and charity to foes had come in to perplex
his thoughts and confuse their issues. The Raid remained,
it was an essential part of actual life; and
burnings and wars went on as before, but they were
no longer, theoretically, at least, matters to win praise
and honour, they were condemned beforehand by the
Christian ethic. A chief, to hold his own, must still
throw open doors of hospitality to his tribe, must dispense
largesse to all-comers, must gather about his board the
neighbours and dependents in riotous assemblies and
festivals. But all this the Christian monk and priest
looked upon with suspicion; they bade him fill his
thoughts with a future Kingdom, rather than with the
earthly one to which he had been born, and to keep his
soul in humble readiness by prayers and fastings, by
seclusion and self-sacrifice. The great disjointure is
everywhere apparent; chiefs are seen flying from their
plain duties to their clans in order to win a heavenly
chiefdom, not of this world; kings retire into hermitages,
and whole villages take on the aspect and system of life
of the monastery. To escape a network of religious
service so closely spread throughout the country was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
impossible; all that the half-convinced could do was to
relieve his soul in legend and song and jest. Hence the
large amount of this literature of protest, coming to us
curiously side by side with poems breathing the very
spirit of religious devotion, the work of peaceful recluse
or retired monk.</p>

<p>For the movement had its other aspect. If the warrior
or chief resigned much in becoming a Christian monk,
there is no doubt that he gained as well. Contemporaneous
religious poetry in the Middle Ages is elsewhere
overshadowed by the cast of theologic thought. The
"world" from which the saint must flee is no mere
symbol, denoting the perils of evil courses; it is the actual
visible earth, its hills and trees and flowers, and the beauty
of its human inhabitants that are in themselves a danger
and a snare. St. Bernard walking round the Lake of
Geneva, unconscious of its presence and blind to its
loveliness, is a fit symbol of the tendency of the religious
mind in the Middle Ages. Sin and repentance, the fall
and redemption, hell and heaven, occupied the religious
man's every thought; beside such weighty themes the
outward life became almost negligible. If he dared to
turn his mind towards it at all, it was in order to extract
from it some warning of peril, or some allegory of things
divine. In essence, the "world" was nothing else than a
peril to be renounced and if possible entirely abandoned.</p>

<p>But the Irish monk showed no such inclination,
suffered no such terrors. His joy in nature grew with his
loving association with her moods. He refused to mingle
the idea of evil with what God had made so good. If he
sought for symbols, he found only symbols of purity and
holiness. The pool beside his hut, the rill that flowed
across his green, became to his watchful eye the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
manifestation of a divine spirit washing away sin; if the birds
sang sweetly above his door, they were the choristers of
God; if the wild beasts gathered to their nightly tryst,
were they not the congregation of intelligent beings
whom God Himself would most desire? The friendly
badgers or foxes of the wood that came forth, undismayed
by the white or brown-robed figure who seemed to have
taken up his lasting abode amongst them, became to
his mind fellow-monks, authorised members of his
strange community. Amongst his feathered and furred
associates, he read his Psalms and Hours in peace; sang
his periodic hymn to St. Hilary or St. Brigit, and performed
his innumerable genuflexions and "cross-vigils."
Here, from time to time, he poured forth in spontaneous
song his joy in the life that he had elected as his own.
When King Guaire of Connaught stands at the door of
the hermitage in which his brother Marvan had taken
refuge from the bustle of court life, and asks him why he
had sacrificed so much, Marvan bursts forth into a poem
in praise of his hermit life, and the King is fain to confess
that the choice of the recluse was the wiser one;
when St. Cellach of Killala is dragged into the forest
by his comrades and threatened with death, not even the
sight of the four murderers lying at his feet with swords
ready drawn in their hands to slay him can prevent him
from greeting the Dawn in a beautiful song.</p>

<p>The saint who, like St. Finan, lived shut up within
his cell, in many cases lost his mental balance, and degenerated
into a mere Fakir, winning heaven by the
miseries of his self-imposed mortifications; but the
monk who trusted himself to untrammelled intercourse
with nature, preserved his underlying sanity. For
whether or no the hundreds of daily genuflexions were
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
performed, the patch of ground around the solitary's
cell must be ploughed or sown or reaped; the apples
must be gathered or the honeysuckles twined. The
salmon or herring must be netted or angled for. Thus
nature and its needs kept the hermit on the straight and
simple paths of physical and mental healthfulness, however
he might try to escape into a wilderness of his own
imaginings.</p>

<p>The early poetry, we feel, is on the whole joyous;
whether pagan or Christian in tone, it arises from a happy
heart. The pagan is more robust, more vigorous; the
Christian gentler and more reflective; but alike they are
free from the mournful note of despair that throws a
settled gloom over much of the later literature.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The Ossianic poems have quite a distinctive tone;
in them we catch the abounding energy belonging to the
days of the hunt of the wild native boar or stag, when all
the country was one open hunting-ground, fit for men
whose ideal was that of the sportsman and the warrior.
Besides romantic tales, we have a whole body of poetry,
loosely strung together under the covering name of
Ois&iacute;n, or Ossian, and usually ascribed to him or to
Fionn mac Cumhall, his father and chief, dealing with the
themes of war and of the chase. They are often in the
nature of the protest of the fighting and hunting-man
against the claims of religion. He is perpetually proclaiming
that the sounds and sights of the forest and seashore
are more dear to him than any others, and when he is
called upon to give the first place to the duties of religion,
placed before him, as it usually is, in its most enfeebling
aspect, he raises the stout protest that the hunting-horn
has greater attractions for him than the tinkling
bell which calls to prayer.</p>

<p class="p1">There is the ring of the obstinate pagan about such
verses; and many poems are wholly occupied by an unholy
wrangling between the representative of the old
order, Ois&iacute;n, and the representative of the new, St.
Patrick. The poems themselves probably date from a
far later period than either.</p>

<p>More healthy are the true hunting songs. Many of
these are in praise of the Isle of Arran, in the Clyde, a
favourite resort during the sporting-season both for the
Scottish and Irish huntsman. In the poem we have
called "The Isle of Arran," from the "Colloquy of the
Ancient Men," the charm of the Isle is well described.
We have in it the same pure joy in natural scenery that
we find in the poems of the religious hermits, but the
tone is manlier and more emphatic.</p>

<p>Occasionally a fiercer note creeps into the hunter's
mood. The chase of the boar and deer was not without
its dangers. Winter, and the unfriendly clan hard by,
or the lean prowling wolf at night, were real terrors to
the small companies encamped on the open hill-side or
in the forest. Though the warrior in peaceful times
loved the chase of swine and stag, his hand had done and
was always ready to do sterner work when opportunity
offered. The poem "Chill Winter" has a note of almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
savage exultation; the old fighter turns from his present
perils and discomforts to remember the warrior onslaughts
which had left the glen below him silent, and its
once happy inhabitants cold in death; colder, as he
gladly reflects, than even he himself feels on this chill
winter's night. It is the voice of the ancient warrior,
who thought no shame of slaying, but thanked God when
he had knocked down his fellow. Whether he, in his
turn, were the undermost man, or whether he escaped,
he cared not at all.</p>

<p>Two difficulties face the modern reader in coming for
the first time upon genuine Irish literature, whether
poetry or prose. The first is the curious feeling that we
are hung between two worlds, the seen and the unseen;
that we are not quite among actualities, or rather that we
do not know where the actual begins or where it ends.
Even in dealing with history we may find ourselves
suddenly wafted away into some illusory spirit-world with
which the historian seems to deal with the same sober
exactness as in detailing any fact of ordinary life. The
faculty of discerning between the actual and the imaginary
is absent, as it is absent in imaginative children;
often, indeed, the illusory quite overpowers the real, as
it does in the life of the Irish peasant to-day.</p>

<p>There is, in most literatures, a meeting-place where the
Mythological and the Historic stand in close conjunction,
the one dying out as the other takes its place. Only in
Ireland we never seem to reach this point; we can never
anywhere say, "Here ends legend, here begins history."
In all Irish writing we find poetry and fact, dreams and
realities, exact detail and wild imagination, linked closely
hand in hand. This is the Gael as revealed in his literature.
At first we are inclined to doubt the accuracy of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
any part of the story; but, as we continue our examination,
we are surprised at the substantial correctness of the
ancient records, so far as we are able to test them, whether
on the historical or on the social side. The poet is never
wholly poet, he is also practical man; and the historian
is never wholly chronicler and annalist, he is also at the
back of his mind folklorist, lover of nature, dreamer. It
is the puzzle and the charm of Ireland.</p>

<p class="pmb1">A good example of this is the very beautiful anonymous
Irish poem, rich in poetic imagery, addressed to Ragnall
or Reginald, son of Somerled, lord of the Isles from 1164-1204.
This poem, written for an historical prince,
begins with a description of the joys of the fairy palace,
"Emain of the Apples," whence this favoured prince is
supposed by the poet to have issued forth:</p>

<div class="block3a">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many, in white grass-fresh Emain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men on whom a noble eye gazes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The rider of a bay steed impetuously)<br /></span>

<span class="i19">Shapely, branch-fresh.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Are the fields ploughed in autumn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the pure corn of the Lord's Body."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">The poet's mind wanders from the ancient Emain,
capital of Ulster, to the allegorical Emain, the dwelling
of the gods or fairy-hosts, who were thought of as inhabiting
the great tumuli on the Boyne; again, he transplants
his fairy-land to the home of Ragnall, and seems
to place it in Mull or the Isle of Man, which was indeed
the especial abode of Manannan, the Ocean-god and
Ruler of Fairy-land.</p>

<p class="p1">We recognise that this is fine poetry, but we feel also
that it needs a specialised education thoroughly to understand
it. The world from which it hails is not our world,
and to comprehend it we must do more than translate, we
must add notes and glossary at every line; but no poetry,
especially poetry under the initial disadvantage of a translation,
could retain its qualities under such treatment.</p>

<p>In all the ancient verse we meet with these obstacles.
Even much of the most imaginative Ossianic poetry becomes
too difficult from this point of view for the
untrained reader.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Take the fine poem detailing the history of the Shield
of Fionn. Poetic addresses to noted weapons are common
enough, and are not confined to Irish literature;
but the adventures of this shield pass beyond the ordinary
uses of human battles, and enter the realm of mythology.
The very name given to it, the "Dripping Ancient
Hazel," carries us into a world of poetic imagination.</p>

<p class="p1">Or take again the strange mythological poem of the
"Crane-bag," made out of the skin of a wandering
haunted crane, which had once been a woman; condemned
for "two hundred white years" to dwell in "the house
of Manannan," <i>i.e.</i> in the wastes of the ocean, ever seeking
and never finding land. When the wanderings came to
an end, and the unhappy Crane-woman died, Manannan
(the Ocean-god) made of her skin a bag into which he put
"every precious thing he had; the shirt of Manannan
and his knife, the girdle of Goibniu (the Vulcan of Irish
legend); the king of Scotland's shears, the king of Lochlann's
helmet, and the bones of the swine of Asal&mdash;these
were the treasures that the Crane-bag held.... When
the sea was full, its treasures were seen in its midst;
when the fierce sea was on ebb, the Crane-bag was
empty." The story has the impress of great age, and
manifold changes; it belongs to the period when the
gods were not yet transformed into human beings, but
were still prim&#230;val elemental powers, impersonations of
fire and light and water, and the wisdom that is above
mankind. But the link is lost, and the story remains a
suggestion only, vague and indistinct. As an image of
the hollow ocean, holding the treasures of the Sea-god,
the idea is, however, full of force and beauty.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The second difficulty, which is closely connected with
the first, lies in the retention of the ancient and unfamiliar
nomenclature; the old geographical and family
names, which have dropped out of actual use, being
everywhere found in the poetry.</p>

<p>Scotland is still Alba in Irish, as it was in the sixth
century; &Eacute;ire (gen. &Eacute;rinn) is the ordinary name for
Ireland, not only in poetry, as is commonly supposed, but
in the living language of the country. But it has besides
an abundance of specially poetic names, such as Inisfail,
"the island of Destiny," Banba, Fodla, &amp;c., connected
with early legends, and these, if we are to understand
the poetry, we must accustom ourselves to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span></p>

<p>England is still to-day the land of the Saxons to the Gael, and
its inhabitants are the "Sassenachs"; the Irishman persists
in disregarding the coming of the Angles. We
may talk of the extinction of the Gaelic tongue, but in
his poetry, as in every place-name of stream or hill or
townland all over the country, it is about us still. In the
poetry we are back in Gaelic Ireland; the old tribal distinctions,
the old clan names, meet us on every page.
What does the modern man know of Leth Cuinn or Leth
Mogha, the ancient divisions of the North and South,
or of the stories which gave them birth? What of
Magh Breagh or Magh Murtheimne? What of Emain
Macha and Kincora? Who, again, are the Clann Fiachrach
or the Eoghanacht, or the Children of Ir or Eiber?
Even before the much later titles of Thomond and
Desmond, of Tyrconnell and Tyrowen he is somewhat
at a loss.</p>

<p>But to the bard the past is always present, the ancient
nomenclature is never extinct. The legend which caused
the River Boyne to be called "The forearm of Nuada's
wife," or the tumuli on its banks to be thought of as the
"Elfmounds of the wife of Nechtan," are familiar to him;
and to enter into the spirit of the mythological poetry
we must know something of Irish folklore and tradition.
Many of these expressions have a high imaginative significance,
as when the sea is called the "Plain of Ler" (the
elder Irish Sea-god), or its waves are "the tresses of
Manannan's wife" or the "Steeds of Manannan."</p>

<p>Of the large body of bardic poetry we have been unable
to give an adequate representation, partly from
considerations of space, but also because we are not yet,
until a larger quantity of this poetry has been published,
able to estimate its actual poetic value. Much fine poetry
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
by the historic bards undoubtedly exists, but we have as
yet only a few published fragments to choose from. The
first specimen we give, Teigue Dall O'Higgin's appeal to
O'Rourke of the Bulwarks (<i>na murtha</i>), must stand as an
example of much similar poetry in and about his own day.</p>

<p>The call to union against England or against some local
enemy sounds loud and constant in the bardic poems.
There is much anti-English poetry; poetry which has for
its object the endeavour to unite for a single purpose the
chiefs who had split up the provinces into small divisions
under separate leaders, each fighting for his own hand.</p>

<p>To stir up the lagging or too peaceful chief was one of
the prime duties of the bard; to address to him congratulations
on his accession, or to bewail him when he
died, was his official function; and to judge by the quantity
of paper covered with these laudatory effusions and
elegies, he performed his task with punctilious care. It
was likely that he would do so, for the fees for a poem
that gave satisfaction were substantial. We miss the
family bard in these days; there is no one at hand to praise
indifferently all that we do.</p>

<p>The bardic poetry attracted the genius of Mangan,
and his "Farewell to Patrick Sarsfield" and O'Hussey's
"Ode to the Maguire," are not only fine poetry, but
excellent representations of two of the finest of the bardic
poems. Elsewhere in his poems, we have usually too
much Mangan to feel that the tone of the original is
faithfully conveyed. His soaring poem, "The Dark
Rosaleen," can hardly be said to represent the Irish
"Rois&iacute;n Dubh," of which, for purposes of comparison, we
give a literal rendering; beautiful as Mangan's poem is,
it has to our mind lost something of the exquisite grace
of the original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">It may be well to indicate here the relations between
Mangan's version and the original in the poem in which
he keeps most strictly to the words of the bard. "O'Hussey's
Ode to the Maguire," that fine address of the
Northern bard, O'Hussey, to his young chief, whose warlike
foray into Munster in the depth of winter filled his
mind with anxiety and distress. A literal translation of
the opening passage reads as follows:</p>

<div class="block3a">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Too cold for Hugh I deem this night, the drops so<br /></span>
<span class="i2">heavily downpouring are a cause for sadness;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">our companion's lot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the clouds' bosoms the water-gates of heaven are<br /></span>
<span class="i2">flung wide; small pools are turned by it to seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">all its destructiveness hath the firmament spewed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">out.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A pain to me that Hugh Maguire to-night lies in a<br /></span>
<span class="i2">stranger's land, 'neath lurid glow of lightning-bolts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and angry armed clouds' clamour;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A woe to us that in the province of Clann Daire (Southwest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Munster) our well-beloved is couched, betwixt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">a coarse cold-wet and grass-clad ditch and the<br /></span>
<span class="i2">impetuous fury of the heavens."<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">But it is not, after all, the verses of the bards, even of
the best of them, that will survive. It is the tender religious
songs, the passionate love-songs, the exquisite addresses
to nature; those poems which touch in us the common
ground of deep human feeling. Whether it came to us
from the sixth century or from the sixteenth, the song
of Crede for the dead man, whom she had grown to love
only when he was dying, would equally move us; the
passionate cry of Liadan after Curithir would wring our
hearts whatever century produced it. The voice of love
is alike in every age. It has no date.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>
<p>Having written so far, we begin to wonder whether it
was wise or necessary to set so much prose between the
reader and the poems which, as we hope, he wishes to
read. In an ordinary anthology, the interruption of a
long preface is a mistake and an intrusion, for, more
than any other good art, good poetry must explain itself.
The mood in which a poem touches us acutely may be
recorded, but it cannot be reproduced in or for the
reader. He must find his own moment. For the most
part, these Irish poems need no introduction. We need
no one to explain to us the beauty of the lines in the
"Flower of Nut-brown Maids":</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I saw her coming towards me o'er the face of the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a star glimmering through the mist";<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">or to remind us of the depth of Cuchulain's sorrow when
over the dead body of his son he called aloud:</p>

<div class="block3a">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The end is come, indeed, for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a man without son, without wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the father who slew his own child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a broken, rudderless bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossed from wave to wave in the tempest wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An apple blown loose from the garden-wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am over-ripe, and about to fall;"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1">or to tell us that the "Blackthorn," or "Donall Oge," or
"Eileen Aroon," are exquisite in their pathos and tenderness.
But there are, besides these enchanting things,
which we are prepared to expect from Irish verse, also
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
things for which we are not prepared; unfamiliar themes,
treated in a new manner; and to judge of these, some
help from outside may be useful. The reader who does
not know Ireland or know Gaelic, is ready to accept
softness, the almost endless iteration of expressions conveying
the sense of woman's beauty and of man's affection,
in phrases that differ but little from each other; what he
is not prepared for is the sudden break into matter-of-fact,
the curt tone that cuts across much Irish poetry, revealing
an unexpected side of life and character. Even the
modern Irishman is tripped up by the swift intrusion of
the grotesque; the cold, cynical note that exists side
by side with the most fervent religious devotion, especially
in the popular poetry, displeases him. He resents
it, as he resents the tone of the "Playboy of the Western
World"; yet it is the direct modern representative of
the tone of mind that produced the Ossianic lays.</p>

<p class="pmb1">We find it in all the popular poetry; as an example take
the argument of the old woman who warns a young
man that if he persists in his evil ways, there will be no
place in heaven for such as he. The youth replies:</p>

<div class="block3a">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If no sinner ever goes to Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only he who is blessed, there will be wide empty places in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all who follow my way are condemned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell must have been full twenty years and a year ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they could not take me in for want of space."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">The same chill, almost harsh tone is heard in the
colloquy between Ailill of Munster and the woman
whom he has trysted on the night after his death,<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or in
the poem, "I shall not die for you" (p. 286), or in the
verses on the fairy-hosts, published by Dr. Kuno Meyer,
where, instead of praise of their ethereal loveliness, we
are told:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Could anything be more matter-of-fact than the clever
chess-playing of the shee-folk and their pride in it?</p>

<p>A collection of translations must always have some
sense of disproportion. It is natural that translators
should, as a rule, have been attracted, not only to the
poems that most readily give themselves to an English
translation, but to those which are most easily accessible.
The love-songs, such as those collected by Hardiman and
Dr. Douglas Hyde, have been attempted with more or
less success by many translators, while much good poetry,
not so easily brought to hand, has been overlooked.
Dr. Kuno Meyer's fine translations of a number of older
pieces, which came out originally either in separate
publications,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or in the transactions of the Arts Faculty
of University College, Liverpool, have now been rendered
more accessible in a separate collection; but the English
ear is wedded to rhyme, and a prose translation, however
careful and choice, often misses its mark with the
general reader. Long ago, Miss Brooke (in her <i>Reliques
of Irish Poetry</i>) and Furlong (in Hardiman's <i>Irish
Minstrelsy</i>) essayed the translation of a number of the
longer "bardic remains"; and these earlier collectors and
translators will ever retain the gratitude of their countrymen
for rescuing and printing, at a time when little value
was placed upon such things, these stores of Irish song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>But the translations suited better the taste of their own
day than of ours; we cannot read them now, nor do they
in the slightest way represent the verse they are intended
to reproduce. Naturally, too, it is easier to give the
spirit and language of a serious poem than that of a humorous
one in another tongue, so that the more playful
verse has been neglected.</p>

<p>It may be thought that this book is overweighted
by religious and love poems; but in a collection essentially
lyrical, religion and love must ever be the two
chief themes. In Ireland, the inner spirit of the national
genius ever spoke, and still speaks, through them.</p>

<p>Among the people of the quiet places where few
strangers come, and where night passes into day and
day again to night with little change of thought or outward
emotion, simple sorrows and simple pleasures have
still time to ripen into poetry. The grief that came
to-day will not pass away with a new grief to-morrow;
it will impress its groove, straight and deep, upon the
heart that feels it, lying there without hope of a summer
growth to hide its furrow. The long monotonous days,
the dark unbroken evenings are the nurseries of sorrow;
the white open roads are the highways of hope or the
paths for the wayfaring thoughts of despair. The
stranger who came one day comes again no more, though
we watch the long white track never so earnestly; the
boy or girl who went that way to foreign lands has not
thrown his or her shadow across the road again. Where
the turf fire rises curling and blue into the air, where the
young girl stands waiting by the winding "boreen,"
where the old woman croons over the hearth, there we
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
shall surely find, if we know how to draw it forth, that
a well of poetry has been sunk, and that half-unconsciously
the thought of the heart has expressed itself in
simple verse, or in rhythmic prose almost more beautiful
than verse. The minds that produced the touching
melodies that wail and croon and sing to us out of Ireland,
have not the less expressed themselves in melodious
poetry. Here, if anywhere, we may look to find a style
unspoiled by imitation, and a sentiment moving because
it is perfectly sincere. It is thus that such poems as
"Donall Oge" or the "Ro&iacute;sin Dubh" or "My Grief
on the Sea" come into existence.</p>

<p>Where the outward distractions of life are few, the
grave monotony of sea and moor and bog-land, the
swirl of cloud and mist, and the loneliness of waste places
sink more deeply into the mind. The visible is less felt
than the invisible, and life is surrounded by a network
of fears and dreams to which the town-dweller is a
stranger. To-day, in the Western Isles of Ireland and
Scotland, the huntsman going out to hunt, the fisherman
to fish or lay his nets, the agriculturist to sow or reap
his harvest, and the weaver or spinner to wind his yarn,
go forth to their work with some familiar charm-prayer
or charm-hymn, often beautifully called "the Blessings,"
on their lips. The milkmaid calling her cows or churning
her butter, the young girl fearful of the evil-eye, and the
cottager sweeping up her hearth in the evening, laying
herself down to sleep at night, or rising up in the morning,
soothe their fears or smooth their way by some
whispered <i>paider</i> or <i>ortha</i>, a prayer or a verse or a blessing.
The deep religious feeling of the Celtic mind, with its
far-stretching hands groping towards the mysterious and
the infinite, comes out in these spontaneous and simple
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
ejaculations; I have therefore endeavoured to bring
together a few others to add to the groups gathered by
Dr. Hyde in the west of Ireland and by Dr. Carmichael
in the Western Hebrides; but in their original Gaelic
they are the fruit of others' collections, not of my own.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
They are the thoughts of such humble people as the poor
farm-servant who "had so many things to do from dark
to dark" that she had no time for long prayers, and knew
only a little prayer taught her by her mother, which laid
"our caring and our keeping and our saving on the
Sacred Trinity."</p>

<p>I desire to inscribe here my sincere gratitude to the
living authors and authoresses who have kindly given
me permission to use their work, and my gratitude to
those authors who have gone, that they have left us so
much good work to use. Especially I desire to thank
my friends, Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves and Mr. Ernest
Rhys, for permitting the use of unpublished poems.</p>

<p>Many friends have given a ready helping hand in
elucidating difficult words and phrases, and it is a pleasant
task to thank them here. Dr. D. Hyde, Rev. Michael
Sheehan, Rev. P. S. Dinneen, Mr. Tadhg O'Donoghue,
Mr. R. Flower, Miss Hayes, especially, have always
readily come to my assistance; to Miss Eleanor Knott
I am indebted for valuable help in the translation of
the "Saltair na Rann," and to Dr. R. Thurneysen for
suggesting some readings in this difficult poem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Saltair na Rann</span>, or Psalter of the Verses, so-called because
it is divided into 150 poems in imitation of the Psalms of David, is
undoubtedly the most important religious poem of early Ireland.
It may justly be regarded as the Irish <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>Paradise
Regained</i>, for it opens with an account of the Creation of the
Universe, the founding of Heaven and Hell, the fall of Lucifer,
the creation of the Earthly Paradise and of man, the temptation
and fall and the penance of Adam and Eve. After this it sketches
the Old Testament History, leading up to the birth and life of
Christ and closing with His death and resurrection. Though in
general it follows the Bible narrative, it is peculiarly Irish in tone,
and its additions and variations are of the greatest interest to
students of medi&#230;val religious literature. The conception of the
universe in the first poem, with its ideas of the seven heavens,
the coloured and fettered winds, and the sun passing through the
opening windows of the twelve divisions of the heavens, is curious;
the earth, enclosed in the surrounding firmament, "like a shell
around an egg," being regarded as the centre of the universe.</p>

<p>In the portions which relate the life of Adam and Eve, the
author evidently had before him the Latin version of the widely
known <i>Vita Adae et Euae</i>, which he follows closely, introducing
from it several Latin words into his text; but even here the colouring
is purely Irish. The poem is ascribed to Oengus the Culdee,
who lived early in the ninth century; but its language is later,
probably the end of the tenth century.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In 1883 Dr. Whitley Stokes published<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the text from the only
existing complete copy, that contained in the Bodleian MS. Rawl.
B. 502, but no part of it has hitherto been published in English.
The present translation of the sections dealing with the Creation and
with the life of Adam and Eve is purely tentative; the poem
presents great difficulties, and we suffer from the lack of a second
copy with which to compare it.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Miss Eleanor Knott has read
the translations and has helped me with many difficulties; and I
had the advantage of reading parts of the poem in class with
Dr. Kuno Meyer. For the errors which the translation must
undoubtedly contain, I am myself, however, alone responsible.</p>

his fall from heaven, which he says was caused by his
refusal to obey the command of God that he should
worship Adam.

This command he refused, because he,
as the first-created, felt it unworthy of him to adore
Adam, the youngest-born of created things. He details
his present miseries, and his determination to take
revenge on Adam and Eve. The poem or canto ends
with the coming of Adam out of the river, and the

<h2><a id="THE_LOVES_OF_LIADAN">THE LOVES OF LIADAN<br />
AND CURITHIR</a></h2>

<p class="p1 center font09 pmb2">
St. Cummine, in whose days the lovers lived, died 661. The<br />
language is of the ninth century.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>A young poet and poetess of Connaught were betrothed;
but during the year's interval preceding their
marriage, Liadan, for some unexplained reason, took the
veil. When Curithir returned to fetch her to his home,
he found that by her vows she had for ever separated
herself from him. In his despair he determined to
follow her example and become a monk. The lovers
placed themselves together under the direction of St.
Cummine, a severe and hard man, who permitted them
to meet, with the object of accusing them of wrong-doing.
Finally, he gave Curithir the choice of seeing
Liadan without speaking to her, or speaking to her without
seeing. He chooses the latter, and henceforth they
wander round each other's cells, speaking together
through the wattled walls, but never looking on each
other's faces. The time comes when this can be no
longer borne, and Curithir sails away to strange lands on
pilgrimage, so that Liadan saw him no more. She died
upon the flagstone on which Curithir was wont to pray,
and was buried beneath it.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The poem is in the form of a dialogue.</p>

<h2><a id="TEMPEST_ON_THE_SEA">TEMPEST ON THE SEA</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1 pmb2">The original of the following poem was ascribed to Ruman
mac Colm&aacute;in, an Irish poet of the seventh century, whom the <i>Book
of Leinster</i> generously styles "the Homer and Virgil of Ireland."
It has been edited and exquisitely translated in prose by Professor
Kuno Meyer in vol. ii. of <i>Otia Merseiana</i>. He attributes
it to the eleventh century. The old prose account says
that it was made by Ruman, when challenged by the Danes of
Dublin to sing of the sea.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_107_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> O'Rourke, Prince of Brefney, was a man whom Elizabeth and
her representatives in Ireland found it hard to tackle. His handsome
presence, his dignity and pride, gave rise to stories of his
ascendency over Elizabeth herself. When lying prisoner in the
Tower of London, he is said to have sent to ask Elizabeth the
favour of being hung, if hang he must, with a gad or withe, after
his country's fashion, a request which Cox, who relates the story,
says was doubtless willingly granted him. He was executed in
1597. (Cox's <i>Hibernia Anglicana</i>, ed. 1689, p. 399; <i>cf.</i> Bacon's
reference to the story in his essay "Of Custom and Education.")</p>

"For God's sake, thy weighty sorrow banish away, O daughter
of O'Donnell! Short time till thou in self-same guise must tread
the way; the same path's weariness awaits thee. In hand of clay
put not thy trust.... Think on the cross that stands beside thee,
and, in lieu of thy vain sorrowing, from off the sepulchre lift up
thine arm and bid thy grief begone." O'Grady's Cat. of MSS. in

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb2">Sir Charles Gavan Duffy says that the date of this ballad is not
positively known, but it appears to be early in the eighteenth
century, when the flower of the Catholic youth of Ireland were
drawn away to recruit the ranks of the Irish Brigade abroad. It
is accompanied by an air of deep sentiment and touching simplicity.&mdash;<i>Ballad

<h2><a id="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>


<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Colloquy of the Two Sages," edited by Dr.
Whitley Stokes from the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, p. 186a, is
one of the most archaic pieces in tone that have come
down to us. It represents the discussion between an
aged poet and a young aspirant as to the sources of
poetic inspiration, and shows us that the gifts of the
bard were highly regarded as the direct endowment of
the gods. Original in <i>Rev. Celtique</i>, No. xxviii. As in
the following poem, I have made use of the scribal glosses
or explanations wherever they seemed to throw light
upon the original.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Amorgen sang." Professor John MacNeill has most
kindly made a fresh collation of the manuscripts containing
this obscure poem for my use. Parts, especially
from line 20 onward, are doubtful. I have incorporated
with the text such of the glosses as appear to make the
meaning more intelligible, but the glosses themselves
are mere scribes' guesses, often bad ones, at the sense
of a text they did not understand. This poem, though
ascribed to the earliest traditional poet of Ireland, is,
Prof. MacNeill considers, rather pseudo-archaic, than of
really great antiquity. The allusion to "Tetra's kine,"
which is explained in the gloss to mean "the fish of the
sea," alludes to Tetra as Ruler of the Ocean; in the
"Colloquy" we found him ruling in the assemblies of
the dead. The connection between the ocean and the
invisible world is constant in Irish tradition. The poem
appears to be an assertion of the Druid's powers, preparatory
to the incantation for good fishing which follows
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
immediately in most manuscripts. The final lines are
an inquiry into the origin of created things, matter on
which the bard or Druid claimed superior enlightenment.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Song of Childbirth" and the succeeding "Greeting
to the New-born Babe" are taken from the piece
known as "The Birth of Conchobhar" (<i>Compert Conchobhar</i>),
edited from Stowe MS. 992, by Prof. Kuno
Meyer in <i>Rev. Celt.</i> vi. pp. 173-182.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"What is Love?" From the story called the "Wooing
of Etain" (<i>Tochmarc Etaine</i>). Original in <i>Irische
Texte</i>, i. p. 124.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Summons to Cuchulain." From the "Sickbed of
Cuchulain" (<i>Serglige Conculaind</i>). Original, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 216.
Overcome with fairy spells, the hero lies fast bound in
heavy slumber; the song is an appeal to him to throw
off the charm and to arise.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Laegh's Description of Fairy-land." From the same
story, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 218. Laegh is Cuchulain's charioteer,
who went into fairy-land instead of his master, and
returns to extol its beauty.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Lamentation of Fand when she is about to leave
Cuchulain." From the dramatic incident in the same
story, in which Fand, Queen of Fairy-land, and Emer,
Cuchulain's mortal wife, struggle for the affection of the
hero, after Cuchulain's return from fairy-land. Each
woman fully recognises the nobility of the other; and
Fand's parting song, in which she restores him to Emer,
is one of lofty renunciation.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Midir's Call to Fairy-land." From the story called
the "Wooing of Etain" (<i>Tochmarc Etaine</i>), <i>ibid.</i>, p. 132.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Song of the Fairies." From A. H. Leahy's <i>Heroic
Romances of Ireland</i> (D. Nutt, 1905), p. 29, taken from
the same tale. Etain was wife of Eochad (pron. Yochee),
King of Ireland, but Mider, King of Fairy-land, fell in
love with her. He won an entry into the palace by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
playing chess with her husband, who demanded from
Mider as the stake for which they played that the fairy
hosts should clear away the rocks and stones from the
plains of Meath, remove the rushes which made the land
barren, build a causeway across the bog of Lamrach, and
perform other services useful to his realm. The song is
sung by the fairies while they are performing this heavy
task. The final stake is won by Mider, who asks Etain
as his prize.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Lamentation of Deirdre," when her husband and
two sons had been slain by King Conchobhar. She
recalls the happy days spent with her husband in Alba
or Scotland, on Lough Etive, and compares it to her
present misery in the house of the King. Original,
<i>Irische Texte</i>, i. pp. 77-81. In all the above poems there
are many difficult and obscure passages.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Take my Tidings." A ninth century poem, edited
and translated by Dr. Kuno Meyer in his <i>Four Songs
of Summer and Winter</i> (D. Nutt, 1903), and by Dr.
Whitley Stokes in <i>Rev. Celt.</i> xx. p. 258. It is ascribed
to Fionn in the commentary on the "Amra Coluim
Cille." Mr. Graves' poem will be found in his <i>Irish
Poems</i>, i. p. 1 (Maunsel &amp; Co., Dublin).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Second Winter Song." Text and translation in Dr.
Kuno Meyer's <i>Four Songs of Summer and Winter</i>. A longer
poem on similar lines is to be found in the tale called the
"Hiding of the Hill of Howth," <i>Rev. Celt.</i> xi. p. 125,
reprinted in his <i>Ancient Irish Poetry</i> (Constable), p. 57;
but in the former version the complaint of the lazy servant-lad
is answered by a fine song in which Fionn praises
the signs of coming spring in earth and air.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"In Praise of May." Original and translation published
by Dr. K. Meyer from the tale called "The Boyish
Exploits of Finn" in <i>Rev. Celt.</i> v. p. 195. It is said to
have been composed by Fionn after he received inspiration
by eating the "Salmon of Knowledge" at the River
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Boyne. Mr. Rolleston's poem is to be found in his
<i>Sea-Spray</i> (Maunsel, 1909).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Isle of Arran." The Arran here spoken of is the
Scottish island of that name. The Fianna were accustomed
to spend part of the autumn and winter hunting
in that island. The poem occurs in the long Ossianic
tract called "The Colloquy of the Ancients," published
by Standish Hayes O'Grady in <i>Silva Gadelica</i> (Williams
and Norgate, 1892). Text, p. 102; translation, p. 109.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Parting of Goll with his Wife." From <i>Duanaire
Finn</i>, edited by Prof. John MacNeill (Irish Texts Soc, vii.,
1908), pp. 23 and 121. Goll was leader of the Connaught
Fians and was opposed to Fionn, the chief of the Leinster
warriors. He is described as a man of lofty disposition
and great valour. In this poem he is standing, driven
to bay by his enemies, on a bare rocky promontory, his
wife only beside him, cut off from all hope of escape.
Few poems relating to Goll remain in Ireland, but a good
many survive in the Western Highlands of Scotland.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Youth and Age." <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 80 and 194. It is Ois&iacute;n
(Ossian) who here laments his departed youth.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Chill Winter." From the "Colloquy of the Ancients,"
<i>Silva Gadelica</i>, text, p. 172; translation, p. 192.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Sleep-song of Grainne." From <i>Duanaire Finn</i>,
pp. 85 and 198. Dermot, who has carried off Grainne,
the wife of Fionn, is lying down to rest in the forest, when
Grainne hears the approach of their pursuers. She sings
over him this passionate lullaby, in which the restless
activities and foreboding terrors of the animal world are
aptly used to heighten the sense of their own danger.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The slaying of Conbeg, Fionn's beloved hound."
Original in <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, ix. No. 104, Feb. 1899, p. 328;
the poem occurs in the "Colloquy of the Ancients,"
where the readings are slightly different (<i>Silva Gadelica</i>,
text, p. 143).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Fairies' Lullaby." Original in <i>Waifs and
Strays of Celtic Tradition</i>, Argyleshire Series, No. iv.
(David Nutt, 1891). It was collected in Argyleshire by
John Gregorson Campbell.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Lay of the Forest Trees." Original in <i>Silva
Gadelica</i>, i. p. 245; trans., ii. p. 278. This curious poem,
which contains much folklore regarding forest-trees,
arose out of the gathering of wood for a fire in the open
air, by a servant or "Man of Smoke," as he is called.
He accidentally threw upon it a block around which
woodbine had twined. This called forth a protest from
the onlookers, who declared that the burning of the
woodbine would certainly bring ill-luck.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"St. Patrick's Breastplate." See Dr. Kuno Meyer's
<i>Ancient Irish Poetry</i> (Constable), pp. 25-7. Original in
Stokes' and Strachan's <i>Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus</i>, ii.
p. 354. Probably eighth century.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Patrick's Blessing on Munster," ninth century.
Original in Dr. Whitley Stokes' <i>Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick</i>, p. 216; literal translation in Dr. Kuno Meyer's
<i>Ancient Irish Poetry</i>, p. 29. The present poetic rendering,
kindly contributed to my book by Mr. A. P. Graves, has
not hitherto been published.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Columcille's Farewell to Aran." See Dr. Douglas
Hyde's <i>Three Sorrows of Story-telling</i> (T. Fisher Unwin,
1895), pp. 146-8.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Columba in Iona." Printed in William Skene's
<i>Celtic Scotland</i>, ii. p. 92, from an Irish manuscript in the
Burgundian Library, Brussels. It bears the ascription
"Columcille fecit," and was transcribed and translated
by O'Curry for Dr. Todd. Many poems are ascribed to
the Saint, but the language of most of them is later than
his time.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Hymn to the Dawn." From <i>Silva Gadelica</i>, by
Standish Hayes O'Grady (Williams &amp; Norgate); original,
vol. i. p. 56; literal trans., ii. p. 59. The hymn was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
composed by St. Cellach on the morning on which he
was slain by his old friends and fellow-students, who had
been bought over to destroy him.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Song of Manchan the Hermit." Original in
<i>&Eacute;riu</i>, i. p. 39. A ninth century poem, with translation
by Dr. Kuno Meyer.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"A Prayer." Original and literal translation by Miss
Mary E. Byrne in <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, ii., Part i. p. 89.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Loves of Liadan and Curithir." This touching
poem illustrates the tyrannical use sometimes made of
their authority by the monks of the ancient Irish Church.
St. Cummine, who was the confessor or "soul-friend"
of the lovers, seems to have been a hard and censorious
man. He lived in the first half of the seventh century.
The poem, as we have it, is of the ninth century. Edited
with translation by Dr. Kuno Meyer (D. Nutt, 1902).
The love song has been reprinted in his <i>Ancient Irish
Poetry</i>.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Lay of Prince Marvan." This song takes the
form of a colloquy between Marvan, who had left his
royal station to adopt a hermit life, and his brother
King Guaire of Connaught (<i>d.</i> 662). Guaire, visiting
him in his retirement, inquires why he prefers to sleep
in a hut rather than in the comfort of a kingly palace;
in reply Marvan bursts forth into a song in praise of
his retired woodland life. Original in <i>King and Hermit</i>,
edited by Dr. Kuno Meyer (D. Nutt, 1901); translation
reprinted in <i>Ancient Irish Poetry</i>, p. 47.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Song of Crede." Text and translation in <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, ii.
p. 15; its editor, Dr. Kuno Meyer, ascribes it to the tenth
century. I have to thank Mr. A. P. Graves for most
kindly giving me permission to use his unpublished poem.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Student and his Cat," eighth or ninth century.
Written on the margin of a codex of St. Paul's Epistles,
in the monastery of Carinthia. Original and translation
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
in Stokes' and Strachan's <i>Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus</i>, ii.
p. 293.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Song of the Seven Archangels." Original in <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, ii.,
Part i. pp. 92-4, with literal translation by Thomas
P. O'Nowlan. Mr. Ernest Rhys' poetical version, kindly
contributed by him to this book, has not hitherto been
published.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Saints of Four Seasons." Original in <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, i., Part ii.
pp. 226-7, with translation by Miss Mary E. Byrne.
Mr. P. J. McCall's poetical version is printed in his <i>Irish
Fireside Songs</i> (M. H. Gill, Dublin, 1911).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Feathered Hermit." Original printed by Dr.
K. Meyer in <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, iv., No. 40, February 1892,
from a marginal note on Harl. MS. 5280 (Brit. Mus.).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Blackbird." Marginal note from a copy of
Priscian in the monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland.
Original in Stokes' and Strachan's <i>Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus</i>,
p. 290.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Deus Meus." Printed by Dr. Whitley Stokes in the
<i>Calendar of &AElig;ngus</i>, clxxxv. It is found written on the
margin of the <i>Leabhar Breac</i>, facs., p. 101, and is there
ascribed to Maelisu ua Brolcan (<i>d.</i> 1086). Dr. George
Sigerson's poetical rendering will be found in his <i>Bards
of the Gael and Gall</i> (T. Fisher Unwin, 1897), p. 193.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Soul's Desire." Original and literal translation by
Dr. Kuno Meyer in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, vol. v., No.6,
1894, p. 95. Though printed from comparatively late
copies, the hymn gives the impression of being ancient.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Song of the Sea." Original and literal translation by
Dr. Kuno Meyer in <i>Otia Merseiana</i> (Liverpool), ii. p. 76.
It is ascribed to the poet Ruman, who died 707, but the
editor believes it to be of the eleventh century.</p>

the Scottish <i>Book of the Dean of Lismore</i>, edited by Rev.
Thos. M'Lauchlan.</p>

(Todd Lectures, V., 1894); see also <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, iv.
p. 89, and Kuno Meyer's <i>Ancient Irish Poetry</i>, p. 42.
Eleventh century? Mr. Graves has kindly given me
permission to use his excellent unpublished version.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Consecration." Original from the <i>Book of the Dean
of Lismore</i>, a collection of poems made in the Western
Islands about 1512 by Sir James McGregor, Dean of
Lismore, Argyleshire, p. 121. It contains many Irish
poems. This and the two following poems are ascribed
to Murdoch O'Daly, called "Muredach Albanach," or
Murdoch the Scot, on account of his long residence in
that country. He is styled "Bard of Erin and Alba."
He was a Connaught poet, who ended a stormy career
by retiring to the Irish monastery of Knockmoy. It is
probable that these religious poems, if not actually
written by him, were composed about his period.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Teach me, O Trinity," <i>ibid.</i>, p. 123.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Shaving of Murdoch," <i>ibid.</i>, p. 158 <i>note</i>, from a
translation made by Standish H. O'Grady. This curious
poem refers to the tonsuring of the bard and his contemporary
Connaught chieftain, Cathal of the Red Hand,
when they entered the monastery of Knockmoy together.
In Scotland Murdoch is remembered as the first of the
Macvurrachs, bards to the Macdonalds of Clanranald.
He lived 1180-1225, and Cathal of the Red Hand, 1184-1225.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Eileen Aroon." Original in Hardimen, i. p. 264; it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
should be compared with the version, <i>ibid</i>., p. 211. The
present is the oldest form. Carol O'Daly, who composed it,
was an accomplished Connaught gentleman, whose desire
to marry Eileen Kavanagh was frustrated by her friends.
He fled the country, but returned, disguised as a harper,
on the eve of her marriage to another suitor, and entered
the guest-chamber. He poured out this impassioned
appeal with such good effect, that Eileen fled with him
that night. The last lines are a welcome to her in response
to her avowal of love. The air is very ancient;
in Scotland it is known as "Robin Adair."</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Downfall of the Gael." Original in Hardiman's
<i>Irish Minstrelsy</i>, ii. p. 102. O'Gnive, bard of the O'Neills
of Clandaboy, accompanied Shane O'Neill to London in
1562, on the occasion of that chief's visit to Queen Elizabeth.
The poem is a lament over the condition of Ireland
and the inaction of the chiefs. Sir Samuel Ferguson's
rendering will be found in <i>Lays of the Western Gael</i>
(Sealy, Bryers &amp; Walker, 1888), p. 136.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Address to Brian O'Rourke of the Bulwarks" (<i>na
murtha</i>), a poem of seventy quatrains from Egerton MS.
iii., art. 85. Dr. Standish Hayes O'Grady has given
specimens of this poem in his valuable <i>Catalogue of Irish
MSS. in the British Museum</i>, pp. 412-20. Another poem
addressed to the same chief will be found in Hardiman,
ii. pp. 266-305, by John mac Torna O'Mulchonaire.
The writer of the present poem, Teigue O'Higgin, called
Teigue "Dall," <i>i.e.</i> the Blind, on account of his blindness,
is one of the best of all the tribal poets of Ireland. He
was poet to the chiefs of Co. Sligo, but he came to an
untimely end on account of a satire made by him on the
O'Haras, who had ill-used him, some time before 1617.
In the poem we give, he endeavours to arouse Brian to
action, and calls on him to unite the clans against England,
a challenge which O'Rourke did not fail to obey.
It is a good sample of much bardic poetry of the period.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Ode to the Maguire," by Eochadh O'Hosey or Hussey,
the last bard of the Maguires, whose strongly fortified
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
castle still frowns upon the waters of the Upper and
Lower Lochs Erne, at Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh. His
young chief, Hugh Maguire, had marched into Munster
in the depth of the winter of 1599-1600, with 2500 foot
and 200 horse on a warlike foray; the bard, sitting at
home in Fermanagh, bewails the hardships which he feels
sure the chief and his followers are enduring in the open
camps during the winter's weather. A fine copy of this
poem is found in the O'Gara manuscript in the Royal
Irish Academy, Dublin, of which Egerton III is a copy
(and see O'Grady's <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 451).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"A Lament for the Princes of Tyrone and Tyrconnel,"
by the family bard, Red Owen Mac Ward, in the form of
an address of comfort to O'Donnell's sister, Nuala, who
is supposed to be weeping over her brother's grave in
Rome, where he had taken refuge after his flight from
Ireland. He lies buried, beside Hugh O'Neill, in the
Church of San Pietro Montario, on the Janiculum. The
bard imagines the clans of the North of Ireland gathering
to bewail the dead and share Nuala's grief. Though
Mangan's broken metre imparts a fervour and fire to the
original, he adds nothing to its slow monotonous impressiveness.
For original see Egerton III, Art. 48
(Brit. Mus.), and translation of extracts in O'Grady's
<i>Catalogue</i>, pp. 371-3. Mangan's version has been often
reprinted.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Co. Mayo." There are many versions of this favourite
song. That given here is said to have been composed by
a bard named Thomas Flavell, a native of Bophin on the
Western Seaboard. Hardiman gives the Irish of this
song, i. p. 337; and also another version by David
O'Murchadh, or Murphy, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 229-33. Flavell was a
poor dependent on the fourth Earl of Mayo, and lived
about the middle of the seventeenth century. For a
different song of the same name, see Dr. Hyde's <i>Poems of
Raftery</i>, p. 96.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Flower of Nut-brown Maids" is the oldest of
the numerous songs written to the air "Uileac&aacute;n Dubh O."
This poem dates from the seventeenth century, and it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
said to be an invitation addressed by one of the unfortunate
landowners, driven out of Ulster during the plantation
of James I, to his lady, to follow him to Leitrim. It
seems to refer to a time of famine, and is, like many other
love-songs, in the form of a colloquy. Original in Hardiman,
i. p. 258.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Rois&iacute;n Dubh," from the original in O'Daly's <i>Poets
and Poetry of Munster</i>, where two versions are given.
It is the poem on which Mangan founded his "Dark
Rosaleen." The poem is an address to Ireland, veiled as
a woman. Hardiman gives some quatrains in vol. i.
pp. 254-61.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Fair Hills of &Eacute;ire" is one of several sets of words
attached to the tender old air "Uileac&aacute;n Dubh O," or
"Oh, the heavy lamentation." One, rendered familiar
in Dr. Samuel Ferguson's version, beginning, "A plenteous
place is Ireland for hospitable cheer," is said to have been
written by an Irish student in one of the colleges of
France probably early in the seventeenth century, when
most of the promising Irish youths went abroad for their
education. The version here given in Dr. Sigerson's fine
rendering was written by Donnchad Ruadh MacNamara
about 1730. It has also been rendered into English by
Mangan. For the original, see <i>Poems by Donnchadh
Ruadh MacNamara</i>, edited by Tom&aacute;s O'Flanngh&aacute;ile
(1897). Dr. George Sigerson's poem will be found in his
<i>Bards of the Gael and Gall</i> (T. Fisher Unwin, 1897), p. 245.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Love's Despair" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 339). This touching poem
was written by a young farmer of Cork who, near the
time of his marriage, had gone into the city to buy the
wedding-dress for his betrothed. On his way back he
heard that she had been married to another man. In
despair he flung his presents into the fire. His reason
gave way, and he roamed the country henceforth, ever
singing the cruelty of Mary and his own misfortunes. His
story was well known in Co. Waterford, where he lived
a great part of his life. Original in <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, vol. iii.,
1887, p. 22.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>The literal translation of the second stanza runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No one knows my case, or how I may find life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only the woman who has made me ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cure is not on sea or shore, nor in herb or skill of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cure is only in the Flower of Youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not hen from cuckoo, I know not heat from cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At no time do I know my friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not night from day,&mdash;but my heart would know its love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should she come in time to save me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Cruiskeen Lawn." Dr. Sigerson's version (<i>ibid.</i>,
p. 258), here reproduced, shows that this popular air,
better known in connection with O'Keeffe's rollicking
drinking song, was also used as a Jacobite political poem.
The chorus and name of the air, <i>i.e.</i> "The little full jug,"
show that its true intent is bacchanalian. We find this
chorus, like many others, attached to songs of different
significance. Petrie, in his collection of <i>Ancient Irish
Music</i>, p. 37, attaches it to a verse of a lullaby:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My love is upon the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rocking from wave to wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tree without foliage over his head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what does my Love want a-straying there?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(see also <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, viii., 1898, p. 224).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Eamonn an Chnuic" or "Ned of the Hill" is founded
on the history of a famous outlaw named Edmund O'Ryan,
born in Shanbohy, Co. Tipperary, late in the seventeenth
century. His father possessed considerable property in
his native county, but his wild career led to his outlawry.
The piercing note of the words and of the air of the same
name is typical of much of the poetry of the period.
"Ned of the Hill" lies buried near F&aacute;ill an Chluig in the
barony of Kilnemanagh, Co. Tipperary. Some versions
give several other verses, of a different character. It is
a love-song as given by Hardiman, "A ch&uacute;il &aacute;luinn
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
deas," i. p. 268, and by Mangan in his <i>Poets and Poetry
of Munster</i>, p. 264. The literal translation here printed is
from Mr. P. H. Pearse's contributions in the <i>Irish Review</i>,
Dublin (November 1911), p. 437. Mr. Pearse says,
"'Eamonn an Chnuic' is commonly looked upon as a
love-song, but I feel sure that to its shaper and to those
who first heard it, the figure of the outlaw, driven by
rain-storm and bullet-storm and beating against the
closed door, mystically symbolised the lonely cause of
Ireland."</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"O Druimin donn dileas," an early Jacobite song,
sometimes supposed to apply to Prince James Charles
Edward, but more probably to Ireland itself under the
symbolic name of the "Beloved white-backed dun cow."
Original in Hardiman, ii. p. 145. See also in Petrie's
<i>Ancient Music of Ireland</i>, p. 116, a translation by O'Curry.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Do you remember that night?" Original in Petrie's
<i>Ancient Music of Ireland</i>, p. 142. He says it was written
down for him by O'Curry. The account given by him
of its origin does not seem to suit the words.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Exile's Song." Original in <i>Gaelic Journal</i>,
vol. vi., No. 7, 1895, p. 108. Composed by an emigrant
named M'Ambrois (Mac Cambridge), and taken down
from James M'Auley of Glengariff and James M'Naughten
of Cushendall.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Fisherman's Keen." From Crofton Croker's
<i>The Keen in the South of Ireland</i> (Percy Society, 1844),
p. 77. It was communicated to Mr. Croker by Mr.
Maurice O'Connell. A literal translation, taken down
from the lips of Mrs. Harrington, a professional "keener"
of Co. Cork, is given in the same author's <i>Researches in
the South of Ireland</i>. Unfortunately the original Irish is
not preserved by him, nor is the name of the lady given
who, he tells us, wrote the poetical rendering.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Boatman's Hymn." Taken from Sir Samuel
Ferguson's <i>Lays of the Western Gael</i>, 1888, pp. 162-3.
Original in Hardiman, ii. p. 383.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Keen on Art O'Leary" by his wife. Original published
in Mrs. Morgan J. O'Connell's <i>The Last Colonel of
the Irish Brigade</i> (Kegan Paul, 1892), vol. ii., Appendix A.,
and reprinted with some corrections in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i>
(vol. vii., Old Series, No. 74, May 1896), p. 18. Some
corrections and additions are made in the following
number (June 1896). Crofton Croker, in his <i>Keens of
the South of Ireland</i>, tells us that he endeavoured to
recover this dirge but without success. It is a true
example of the spontaneous "keen," with its short
broken lines, containing in quick, natural succession,
appeals, reminiscences, laments; moving backwards and
forwards as the irregular promptings of grief and affection
dictate without form or premeditation. It is, however,
lifted into the sphere of fine poetry by its exceeding
simplicity, and by the passion of grief expressed in its
lines.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">The circumstances in which the poem had its origin
are particularly tragic. Art O'Leary had been an officer
in the Hungarian service, but he returned to Ireland,
where he had a considerable property in Co. Cork, and
where his handsome person and distinguished manners
made him very popular. He married, against the wish
of her parents, Eileen of the Raven Locks, as she was
called from her dark hair, a daughter of Daniel O'Connell
of Derrynane, grandfather of "the Liberator." The
popularity of Art O'Leary excited the jealousy of a
neighbour, a Mr. Morris, whose horse had been beaten
in a race by O'Leary's beautiful mare. Taking advantage
of the Penal Laws, which did not permit a Catholic to
possess a horse valued at more than &#163;5, he demanded
the mare from Capt. O'Leary for this sum. O'Leary
refused, saying that he "would surrender his mare only
with his life." A local magistrate immediately proclaimed
him an outlaw; soldiers were sent to lie in wait for him
as he was returning home at night, and he was shot
through the heart near Carrig-a-nimmy, in May 1773.
His wife was informed of her husband's death by the
return of the mare without its rider. It was many years
before his body was even allowed to be buried in consecrated
ground. Morris was tried for the murder, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
acquitted; he was soon after shot in his house by Arthur's
brother. Art O'Leary's grave is to be seen in the nave
of Kilcrea Abbey, Co. Cork; the inscription states that
he was only twenty-six years of age when he died.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Prologue to 'The Midnight Court'" (<i>Cuirt an

of which we give the Prologue has been published by
Mr. Richard Foley (Riscard O Foghludha) (Hodges,
Figgis &amp; Co.).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Hymn to the Virgin Mary." Original in <i>The Poems
of Egan O'Rahilly</i> (1st ed., Irish Texts Society, vol. iii.,
1900), p. 290. The author, Conchubhar or Conor
O'Riordan was a native of Co. Cork, where he taught
the classics and other subjects to the youths of his
district. He wrote, about the same time as Gray, a
"Meditation in a Country Churchyard," to which this
very beautiful address to the Virgin forms the Epilogue
or "Binding" (<i>ceangal</i> as it is called in Irish). The
whole poem is included in the appendix to Rev. P. S.
Dinneen's edition of O'Rahilly's poems.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Christmas Hymn." Original in Dr. Douglas Hyde's
<i>Religious Songs of Connacht</i> (T. Fisher Unwin, 1906),
vol. ii. pp. 224-6; from an old North of Ireland
manuscript.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"O Mary of Graces." <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 161. Taken down by
Miss Agnes O'Farrelly from a lad in the Aran Islands,

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Cattle-shed." Original in <i>Timthirid Chroidhe
neamhtha Iosa</i> or <i>The Messenger</i> (published by Gill &amp; Son,
Dublin), p. 90. The following nine poems and fragments
are from the same publication, vol. i., Parts 1-4.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The White Paternoster." <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 58. The two versions
of this favourite charm here given, of which the
second is translated from the original in a Kerry journal,
<i>An Lochran</i> (October 1900), should be compared with the
copies printed by Dr. D. Hyde in his <i>Religious Songs</i>,
vol. i. pp. 362-70.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"A Night Prayer." This fragment and the eleven
succeeding prayers were taken down in Irish among the
Decies of Co. Waterford by Rev. M. Sheenan, D.Ph., and
have been published by him in his <i>Cn&oacute; C&oacute;illeadh Craobhaighe</i>
(Gill &amp; Son, Dublin, 1907).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Man who Stands Stiff." From Dr. D. Hyde's
<i>Religious Songs of Connacht</i>, vol. i. p. 101, taken down
from the mouth of Martin Rua O'Gillarna (in English,
Red Martin Forde) of Lisaniska, Co. Galway. He spoke
no English. This poem is a sample of much of the popular
religious poetry dealing with the approach of death and
the danger of continuing in evil courses.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Charm for a Sprain." This and the succeeding
charms are taken from Lady Wilde's <i>Legends, Charms,
and Cures of Ireland</i> (Chatto &amp; Windus). It is unfortunate
that Lady Wilde does not give either her originals
or her authorities.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Before the sun rose at yesterdawn." Original in
Walsh's <i>Irish Popular Songs</i>, 2nd ed. (Gill &amp; Son, Dublin),
p. 146. Edward Walsh, who translated into English
verse a great number of Irish popular songs, lived between
the years 1805-50.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Blackthorn." One of those favourite old songs
of which there are many versions, and verses in one that
are not in another. Like many another Irish song, it
seems to be a colloquy between a maid and her lover,
and it is often difficult to tell if it is the lad or the girl
who is speaking. My version is the one printed in Miss
Borthwick's <i>Ce&oacute;l Sidhe</i>, ii. p. 18 (an excellent collection
of old Irish songs), with two verses added from the version
in Dr. D. Hyde's <i>Love-Songs of Connacht</i> (T. Fisher Unwin,
1893), p. 30. The poem is sad and troubled. Dr. Hyde
says, "There was an old woman in it, long ago, who used
to sing it to me, and she never came to the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Although the rowen-berry tree is high, &amp;c.,'<br /></span>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">that she used not to shed tears from her eye." We can
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
well believe it. Hardiman (i. p. 234) has published a
different version, and Miss Brooke another in her <i>Reliques</i>
(1816), p. 306.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Pastheen Finn," or "Fair little Child." Original in
Hardiman's <i>Irish Minstrelsy</i>, i. p. 217. Dr. Hyde gives
a quite different version in his <i>Love-Songs</i>, p. 65. We
find the <i>curfa</i> or chorus attached to different songs. Sir
Samuel Ferguson's version will be found in his <i>Lays of
the Western Gael</i> (Sealy, Bryers, Dublin, 1888), p. 152.
Hardiman considers that it is an address to the son of
James II, under a secret name.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"She." Original in Miss Brooke's <i>Reliques of Irish
Poetry</i>, p. 232.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Hopeless Love." Given as an example of an old
Irish metre called <i>Dibide baise fri toin</i>, but this poem
was not actually written in this metre.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Would God I were." Original in Hardiman, i. p. 344.
Mrs. Hinkson's setting of the Irish words will be found in
her <i>Irish Love-Songs</i> (T. Fisher Unwin, Cameo Series,
1892).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Branch of the sweet and early rose." William
Drennan, M.D. (<i>b.</i> 1754), died in Belfast in 1820.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"'Tis a Pity." Original in <i>Cl&aacute;irseach na n-Gaedhil</i>,
Part ii., 1902 (Gaelic League Publications). <i>Ce&oacute;l-s&iacute;dhe</i>
(p. 92) gives a different version. There are several other
verses.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Yellow Bittern" (<i>An bun&aacute;n buidhe</i>). Original
in <i>Cl&aacute;irseach na n-Gaedhil</i>, Part v., and <i>Ce&oacute;l-s&iacute;dhe</i>, p. 12.
This translation appeared in the <i>Irish Review</i>, Dublin,
November 1911.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Have you been at Carrack?" Original in Mangan's
<i>Poets and Poetry of Munster</i> (J. Duffy), p. 344. Walsh
thinks it is a song from the South of Ireland.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Cashel of Munster." There are various versions of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
this popular song, set to its air "Cl&aacute;r bog d&eacute;il." One
used by Walsh was, he tells us, given to him by a lady
of Co. Clare. Ferguson's version is taken from Hardiman,
i. p. 238.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Snowy-breasted Pearl." Original in Petrie's
<i>Ancient Music of Ireland</i>, p. 11. Petrie was born in
Dublin in 1789 and died in 1866.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Dark Maid of the Valley" (<i>Bean dubh an Gleanna</i>).
There are two versions and airs of this name. The original
of Mr. P. J. McCall's poem is to be found in Miss Brooke's
<i>Reliques</i>, p. 319. His own rendering was published in
his <i>Irish N&oacute;inins</i> (Sealy, Bryers &amp; Walker, 1894), p. 59.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Coolun." Original in Hardiman, i. p. 250. Two
other versions will be found in Dr. Hyde's <i>Love-Songs of
Connacht</i> (1893), pp. 71-3. One of these beginning, "A
honey mist on a day of frost, in a dark oak wood" is
very tender and sweet. Its air is among the most beautiful
that Ireland has produced. The "Coolun" was a
lock of hair which, having been forbidden by statute, it
became a mark of national sentiment to adopt. It was
usually worn by youths, but in these poems the address
is to a woman.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Ceann dubh dileas," or the "Beloved Dark Head."
Original in Hardiman, i. p. 262. Dr. Hyde gives an
additional verse in his <i>Love-Songs</i>. Burns claimed the
air for Scotland, and Corri published it under the name
of "Oran Gaoil," but it is undoubtedly Irish.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Ringleted Youth of my Love." From Dr. Hyde's
<i>Love-Songs of Connacht</i> (T. Fisher Unwin, 1893), p. 40.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"I shall not die for you." Original, <i>ibid.</i>. p. 138.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Donall Oge." This pathetic song and the one following
it, "The Grief of a Girl's Heart," seem to be portions
of one long song, to the original nucleus of which quatrains
have been added from time to time. Six stanzas were
published by Dr. Hyde in his <i>Love-Songs</i> (pp. 4-6) under
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the title, "If I were to go West"; it would seem that
his "Breed Astore" (p. 76) may also be a portion of the
same poem. Mr. P. H. Pearse, who published several
other stanzas under the title of "Donall Oge," or "Young
Donall," in the <i>Irish Review</i> of August 1911, tells us that
he wrote it down from the words of Denis Dorgan of
Carrignavar, Co. Cork. The Irish will be found printed
in his and Mr. Tadhg O'Donoghue's <i>An t-Aithrise&oacute;ir</i>
(Gaelic League, 1902), p. 7. In all these versions there
are some stanzas alike and some different to the others.
We have printed nearly the whole of them here under
the two titles of "Donall Oge" and "The Grief of a
Girl's Heart." Both are full of the most heartrending
expression of loss and loneliness. Lady Gregory, in her
<i>Poets and Dreamers</i>, published a literal translation of the
latter poem.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Death the Comrade." Original in Dr. Hyde's
<i>Religious Songs</i>, ii. pp. 288-90.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Muirneen of the Fair Hair." Original in Dr. Hyde's
<i>Love-Songs</i>, pp. 10-12. <i>Cf.</i> another Munster version on
p. 16, and one given by Hardiman, i. p. 354.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Red Man's Wife." A popular theme on which
there are many variations. We give two, the originals
of both being taken from Dr. Hyde's <i>Love-Songs</i>, pp. 92
and 94. The first is a Galway version, the second from
Co. Meath. The latter was first printed in the <i>Oban
Times</i>. Yet another version is given in Dr. Hyde's
edition of <i>Raftery's Poems</i>, p. 210.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"My Grief on the Sea." Original in Dr. Hyde's <i>Love-Songs</i>.
It was taken down by him from an old woman
named Biddy Cusruaidh or Crummy, living in the midst
of a bog in Co. Roscommon.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Or&oacute; Mh&oacute;r, a Mh&oacute;ir&iacute;n." Original in Petrie's <i>Ancient
Music of Ireland</i>, p. 120. It was obtained by him from
Teigue MacMahon, a peasant of Co. Clare. Mr. P. J.
McCall's poem was printed in his <i>Pulse of the Bards</i> (Gill
&amp; Son, 1904), p. 50.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Little Yellow Road." Original taken down by
Prof. John MacNeill in Co. Mayo in July 1894, and printed
by him in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i> for that year (vol. v., No. 6),
p. 91. There are several versions of <i>An B&oacute;ithr&iacute;n buidhe</i>;
see for another, Petrie's <i>Ancient Music</i>, p. 24. Mr. Campbell's
translation, kindly contributed to this collection,
has not been published before.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Reproach to the Pipe" (<i>M&aacute;sladh an Ph&iacute;opa</i>). The
original, taken down in Galway, will be found in the
<i>Gaelic Journal</i> (vol. vi., No. 5), p. 73.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Modereen Rue." Mrs. Tynan-Hinkson's poem is not
a direct translation, but a spirited free version of the
favourite Gaelic song of this name; it was published in
<i>The Wind in the Trees</i> (Grant Richards, 1898), p. 98.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Stars Stand Up" (<i>T&aacute;id na realta 'n-a seasadh ar
an aer</i>). Original in <i>Ce&oacute;l-s&iacute;dhe</i>, Part iv., p. 50, among
other places. I have altered the last four lines.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Love Smart." Original in Dr. Hyde's <i>Love-Songs</i>,
p. 22.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Well for Thee." Original, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 130.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"I am Raftery the Poet." From Dr. Hyde's edition
of <i>Raftery's Poems</i> (H. M. Gill &amp; Son, Dublin, 1903), p. 40.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Dust hath closed Helen's eye." Original, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 330.
Mr. W. B. Yeats has slightly worked over Lady Gregory's
rendering. Mary Hynes, who "died of fever before the
famine," has left a tradition of beauty behind her in her
own country. "She was the finest thing that was ever
shaped," said an old fiddler who remembered her well.
Baoile laoi (Ballylee) is a little village of some half-dozen
houses in the barony of Kiltartan. Lady Gregory's
beautiful rendering was published in an article by Mr.
W. B. Yeats in <i>The Dome</i>, New Series, vol. iv. p. 161.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Shining Posy" or "Mary Stanton," <i>ibid.</i>, p. 320.
We must remember that poor Raftery, who praises so
warmly the beauty of women, saw them only with the
eyes of his imagination, for he was blind. His verses
seem to have been impromptu compositions. The classical
allusions are very characteristic of the wandering bards,
who liked to show off their acquaintance with the heroes
of bygone ages.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Love is a Mortal Disease" (<i>Is claoidhte an galar an
gr&aacute;dh</i>). Original in <i>Smo&iacute;l&iacute;n na Rann</i>, a collection of
Connaught songs made by Mr. Fionan McCollum, "Finghin
na Leamhna" (Gaelic League, 1908).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"I am watching my young calves sucking." This
and the two following poems, "The Narrow Road" and
"Forsaken," are translated from Dr. Douglas Hyde's
little collection of original Irish songs called <i>Ubhla de'n
Chraoibh</i>, or <i>Apples of the Bough</i> (Gill &amp; Son, Dublin).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"I Follow a Star." Translated by Seosamh mac
Cathmhaoil (James Campbell) from his own Irish poem,
and published by him in <i>The Gilly of Christ</i> (Maunsell
&amp; Co., Dublin).</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"Nurse's Song." Published by Mr. Alfred M. Williams
in his <i>The Poets and Poetry of Ireland</i> (Houghton, Mifflin
and Co., Boston and New York). The song is traditional,
and its author is unknown.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"A Sleep Song." Original in <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, May
1911, p. 141. The song was partly taken down from
Mr. McAuley Lynch in West Cork, and partly recollected
from childhood by Mr. P. H. Pearse, the translator.</p>

<p class="itt2 pmb2">"The Cradle of Gold." From Mr. Alfred P. Graves'
<i>Irish Poems</i>, ii. p. 117 (Maunsel &amp; Co.). Original in
Petrie's <i>Ancient Music of Ireland</i>, p. 146.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
"Rural Song." Original in Petrie's <i>Ancient Music of
Ireland</i>, p. 43. Joyce's <i>Irish Music</i> gives some extra
